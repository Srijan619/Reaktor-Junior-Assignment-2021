# Takeaway from the project

* Have a web frontend
* Include a Table of Contents with hyperlinks to chapters containing game rules. For instance, “100. General” is a chapter
* Display the selected chapter beside the Table of Contents, containing all rules in that chapter. For instance, “100.2a” is a rule
* Include a search box for filtering the rules displayed on the page, so that you can, for instance, type “commander” and find all rules that mention the word “commander”

***Enable temporary CORS access by requesting demo: https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo***
(This is just a proxy server API and is required to bypass the CORS otherwise the app will not work)
